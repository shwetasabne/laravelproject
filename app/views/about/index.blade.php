Hello,</p>

<p>My name is Shweta Sabne. Currently I work as a Software Engg. at NetApp Inc in Cranberry Township, PA. I did my B.E (Electronics) from University of Mumbai 2008. Upon graduation, I joined TechMahindra Ltd and worked there as a software developer for about a year and half. That experience exposed me to a lot of software technologies, primarily JAVA and MySQL. As a part of training offered at TechMahindra, I also acquired basic skills in C, C++, UNIX and PL/SQL. While working in TechMahindra, I realised that while the industry offered hands-on learnings, I still needed to strengthen my domain knowledge and theoretical knowledge. With that in minds, I decided to do a Masters course from University of Texas at Dallas.</p>

<p>My major at UTD was Telecommunications Engineering (class of 2010), with a focus on Telecom Software. This experience definitely enhanced my skills and enriched my knowledge. I undertook a wide range of courses such as Advanced Computer Networking, Database Design, Algorithmic Aspects of Telecom Networks, Information Retrieval, etc.</p>

<p>As a part of my curriculum, I did internships at Award Solutions, Ericsson Inc and NetApp Inc. Following my internship at NetApp I was offered a full time position, which I took up. Each of these internships exposed me to the newer and upcoming technologies and various industrial domains. My experience at NetApp got me interested in the Storage and Networking Domain and I am still in the process of learning and acquiring knowledge.</p>


<p>My transition from India to USA taught me many things. It has made me more focussed, independent and team player. The cultural shift has made me realise that while there are so many diversity arenas in terms of technology and behaviour, the power of reasoning and the desire to enhance and enrich the quality of life is what binds us all together.</p>

<p>In the ever changing dynamic world of software development, I want to keep learning and practising newer things.
This website is also a consequence of that yearning. While exploring dynamic websites, and recommendation of my peers, I came across the Laravel Framework for php. I have been using it and trying out excercises and so far it has been a fruitful experience.</p>

<p>This is my first dynamic website and hence may have a few misses. I have detailed out the various APIs I have used in this website in the Blogs section.</p>
